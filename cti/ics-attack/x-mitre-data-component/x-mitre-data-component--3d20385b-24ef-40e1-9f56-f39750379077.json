            "description": "Refers to the event in which a new process (executable) is initialized by an operating system. This can involve parent-child process relationships, process arguments, and environmental variables. Monitoring process creation is crucial for detecting malicious behaviors, such as execution of unauthorized binaries, scripting abuse, or privilege escalation attempts.\n\n*Data Collection Measures:*\n\n- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:\n    - EDRs provide process telemetry, tracking execution flows and arguments.\n- Windows Event Logs:\n    - Event ID 4688 (Audit Process Creation): Captures process creation with associated parent process.\n- Sysmon (Windows):\n    - Event ID 1 (Process Creation): Provides detailed logging\n- Linux/macOS Monitoring:\n    - AuditD (execve syscall): Logs process creation.\n    - eBPF/XDP: Used for low-level monitoring of system calls related to process execution.\n    - OSQuery: Allows SQL-like queries to track process events (process_events table).\n    - Apple Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Monitors process creation on macOS.\n- Network-Based Monitoring:\n    - Zeek (Bro) Logs: Captures network-based process execution related to remote shells.\n    - Syslog/OSSEC: Tracks execution of processes on distributed systems.\n- Behavioral SIEM Rules:\n    - Monitor process creation for uncommon binaries in user directories.\n    - Detect processes with suspicious command-line arguments.
