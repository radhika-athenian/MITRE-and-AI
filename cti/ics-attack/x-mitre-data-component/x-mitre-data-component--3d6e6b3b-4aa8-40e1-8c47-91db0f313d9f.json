            "description": "The activity of assigning a new drive letter or creating a mount point for a data storage device, such as a USB, network share, or external hard drive, enabling access to its content on a host system. Examples: \n\n- USB Drive Insertion: A USB drive is plugged in and automatically assigned the letter `E:\\` on a Windows machine.\n- Network Drive Mapping: A network share `\\\\server\\share` is mapped to the drive `Z:\\`.\n- Virtual Drive Creation: A virtual disk is mounted on `/mnt/virtualdrive` using an ISO image or a virtual hard disk (VHD).\n- Cloud Storage Mounting: Google Drive is mounted as `G:\\` on a Windows machine using a cloud sync tool.\n- External Storage Integration: An external HDD or SSD is connected and assigned `/mnt/external` on a Linux system.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nWindows Event Logs\n\n- Relevant Events:\n    - Event ID 98: Logs the creation of a volume (mount or new drive letter assignment).\n    - Event ID 1006: Logs removable storage device insertions.\n- Configuration: Enable \"Removable Storage Events\" in the Group Policy settings:\n`Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Removable Storage Access`\n\nLinux System Logs\n\n- Command-Line Monitoring: Use `dmesg` or `journalctl` to monitor mount events.\n\n- Auditd Configuration: Add audit rules to track mount points.\n- Logs can be reviewed in /var/log/audit/audit.log.\n\nmacOS System Logs\n\n- Unified Logs: Monitor system logs for mount activity:\n- Command-Line Tools: Use `diskutil list` to verify newly created or mounted drives.\n\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools\n\n- EDR solutions can log removable drive usage and network-mounted drives. Configure EDR policies to alert on suspicious drive creation events.\n\nSIEM Tools\n\n- Centralize logs from multiple platforms into a SIEM (e.g., Splunk) to correlate and alert on suspicious drive creation activities.",
