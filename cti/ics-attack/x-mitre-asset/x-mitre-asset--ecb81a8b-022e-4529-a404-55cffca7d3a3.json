The server typically uses one or more automation protocols (e.g., Modbus, DNP3) to communicate with the various low-level control devices such as Remote Terminal Units (RTUs) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). The control server also usually provides an interface/network service to connect with an HMI.",
