The system is used to access the ICS environment securely from external networks, such as the corporate network. The user must first remote into the jump host before they can access ICS devices. The jump host may be a customized Windows server using common remote access protocols (e.g., RDP) or a dedicated access management device. The jump host typically performs various security functions to ensure the authenticity of remote sessions, including authentication, enforcing access controls/permissions, and auditing all access attempts.
