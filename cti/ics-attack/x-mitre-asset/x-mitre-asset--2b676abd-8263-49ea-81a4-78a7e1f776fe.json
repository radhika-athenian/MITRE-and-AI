Input data may include readings about a given environment/device state from sensors, while output data may include data sent back to actuators for them to either undertake actions or change parameter values.(Citation: Guidance - NIST SP800-82) These devices are frequently embedded devices running on lightweight embedded operating systems or RTOSes.
