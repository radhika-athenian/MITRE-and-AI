Workstations typically utilize standard desktop or laptop hardware and operating systems (e.g., MS Windows), but run dedicated control system applications or diagnostic/management software     to support interfacing with the control servers or field devices. Some workstations have a fixed location within the network architecture, while others are transient devices that are directly connected to various field devices to support local management activities.",

The TCA is often used to directly manage ICS environments that do not have any dedicated support for external remote access. Therefore, the TCA provides a mechanism for connectivity and file transfer to many networks/devices, even if they are segmented or \u201cair gapped\u201d from other networks.  "
