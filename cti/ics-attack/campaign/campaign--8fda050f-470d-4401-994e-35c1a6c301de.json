            "description": "The [Unitronics Defacement Campaign](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0031) was a collection of intrusions across multiple sectors by the [CyberAv3ngers](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1027), where threat actors engaged in a seemingly opportunistic and global targeting and defacement of Unitronics Vision Series [Programmable Logic Controller (PLC)](https://attack.mitre.org/assets/A0003) with [Human-Machine Interface (HMI)](https://attack.mitre.org/assets/A0002). The sectors that these PLCs can be commonly found in are water and wastewater, energy, food and beverage manufacturing, and healthcare. The most notable feature of this attack was the defacement of the PLCs' HMIs.(Citation: CISA AA23-335A IRGC-Affiliated December 2023)(Citation: Frank Bajak and Marc Levy December 2023)",
