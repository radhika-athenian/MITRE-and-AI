[Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1129) ransomware has been used in attacks across North America, Europe, and Australia, with a focus on critical infrastructure sectors including manufacturing, education, and IT services. [Akira](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1129) ransomware employs hybrid encryption and threading to increase the speed and efficiency of encryption and runtime arguments for tailored attacks. Notable variants include Rust-based [Megazord](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1191) for targeting Windows and [Akira _v2](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1194) for targeting VMware ESXi servers.(Citation: Kersten Akira 2023)(Citation: CISA Akira Ransomware APR 2024)(Citation: Cisco Akira Ransomware OCT 2024)",
