            "description": "[XCSSET](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0658) is a modular macOS malware family delivered through infected Xcode projects and executed when the project is compiled. Active since August 2020, it has been observed installing backdoors, spoofed browsers, collecting data, and encrypting user files. It is composed of SHC-compiled shell scripts and run-only AppleScripts, often hiding in apps that mimic system tools (such as Xcode, Mail, or Notes) or use familiar icons (like Launchpad) to avoid detection.(Citation: trendmicro xcsset xcode project 2020)(Citation: April 2021 TrendMicro XCSSET)(Citation: Microsoft March 2025 XCSSET)",
