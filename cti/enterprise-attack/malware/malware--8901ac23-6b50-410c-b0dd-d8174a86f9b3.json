Other versions known as Shamoon 2 and Shamoon 3 were observed in 2016 and 2018. [Shamoon](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0140) has also been seen leveraging [RawDisk](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0364) and Filerase to carry out data wiping tasks. Analysis has linked [Shamoon](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0140) with [Kwampirs](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0236) based on multiple shared artifacts and coding patterns.(Citation: Cylera Kwampirs 2022) The term Shamoon is sometimes used to refer to the group using the malware as well as the malware itself.(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018)(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)",
