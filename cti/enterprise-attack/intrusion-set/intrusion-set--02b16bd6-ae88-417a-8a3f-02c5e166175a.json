[BlackByte](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1043) is associated with several versions of ransomware also labeled [BlackByte Ransomware](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1180). [BlackByte](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1043) ransomware operations initially used a common encryption key allowing for the development of a universal decryptor, but subsequent versions such as [BlackByte 2.0 Ransomware](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1181) use more robust encryption mechanisms. [BlackByte](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1043) is notable for operations targeting critical infrastructure entities among other targets across North America.(Citation: FBI BlackByte 2022)(Citation: Picus BlackByte 2022)(Citation: Symantec BlackByte 2022)(Citation: Microsoft BlackByte 2023)(Citation: Cisco BlackByte 2024)",
