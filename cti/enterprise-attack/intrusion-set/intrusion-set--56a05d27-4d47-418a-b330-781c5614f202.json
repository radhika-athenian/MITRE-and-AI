[Sea Turtle](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1041) is notable for targeting registrars managing ccTLDs and complex DNS-based intrusions where the threat actor compromised DNS providers to hijack DNS resolution for ultimate victims, enabling [Sea Turtle](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1041) to spoof log in portals and other applications for credential collection.(Citation: Talos Sea Turtle 2019)(Citation: Talos Sea Turtle 2019_2)(Citation: PWC Sea Turtle 2023)(Citation: Hunt Sea Turtle 2024)",
