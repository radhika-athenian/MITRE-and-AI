Adversaries frequently modify processes to execute malicious payloads, evade detection, or gain escalated privileges.\n\n*Data Collection Measures:* \n\n- Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools:\n    - EDRs can monitor memory modifications and API-level calls.\n- Sysmon (Windows):\n    - Event ID 8 (CreateRemoteThread) \u2013 Detects cross-process thread injection, commonly used in process hollowing.\n    - Event ID 10 (Process Access) \u2013 Detects access attempts to another process, often preceding injection attempts.\n- Linux/macOS Monitoring:\n    - AuditD (ptrace, mmap, mprotect syscalls): Detects memory modifications and debugging attempts.\n    - eBPF/XDP: Monitors low-level system calls related to process modifications.\n    - OSQuery: The processes table can be queried for unusual modifications.\n- Network-Based Monitoring:\n    - Zeek (Bro) Logs: Captures lateral movement attempts where adversaries remotely modify a process.\n    - Syslog/OSSEC: Monitors logs for suspicious modifications.",
