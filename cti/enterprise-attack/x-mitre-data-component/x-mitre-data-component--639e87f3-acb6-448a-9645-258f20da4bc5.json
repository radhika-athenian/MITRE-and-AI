            "description": "contextual information about a file, including attributes such as the file's name, size, type, content (e.g., signatures, headers, media), user/owner, permissions, timestamps, and other related properties. File metadata provides insights into a file's characteristics and can be used to detect malicious activity, unauthorized modifications, or other anomalies. Examples: \n\n- File Ownership and Permissions: Checking the owner and permissions of a critical configuration file like /etc/passwd on Linux or C:\\Windows\\System32\\config\\SAM on Windows.\n- Timestamps: Analyzing the creation, modification, and access timestamps of a file.\n- File Content and Signatures: Extracting the headers of an executable file to verify its signature or detect packing/obfuscation.\n- File Attributes: Analyzing attributes like hidden, system, or read-only flags in Windows.\n- File Hashes: Generating MD5, SHA-1, or SHA-256 hashes of files to compare against threat intelligence feeds.\n- File Location: Monitoring files located in unusual directories or paths, such as temporary or user folders.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nWindows\n\n- Sysinternals Tools: Use `AccessEnum` or `PSFile` to retrieve metadata about file access and permissions.\n- Windows Event Logs: Enable object access auditing and monitor events like 4663 (Object Access) and 5140 (A network share object was accessed).\n- PowerShell: Use Get-Item or Get-ChildItem cmdlets: `Get-ChildItem -Path \"C:\\Path\\To\\Directory\" -Recurse | Select-Object Name, Length, LastWriteTime, Attributes`\n\nLinux\n\n- File System Commands: Use `ls -l` or stat to retrieve file metadata: `stat /path/to/file`\n- Auditd: Configure audit rules to log metadata access: `auditctl -w /path/to/file -p wa -k file_metadata`\n- Filesystem Integrity Tools: Tools like tripwire or AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) can monitor file metadata changes.\n\nmacOS\n\n- FSEvents: Use FSEvents to track file metadata changes.\n- Endpoint Security Framework (ESF): Capture metadata-related events via ESF APIs.\n- Command-Line Tools: Use ls -l or xattr for file attributes: `ls -l@ /path/to/file`\n\nSIEM Integration\n\n- Forward file metadata logs from endpoint or network devices to a SIEM for centralized analysis.",
