            "description": "Refers to the act of accessing a data storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, USB, or network-mounted drive. This data component logs the opening or mounting of drives, capturing activities such as reading, writing, or executing files within an assigned drive letter (e.g., `C:\\`, `/mnt/drive`) or mount point. Examples: \n\n- Removable Drive Insertion: A USB drive is inserted, assigned the letter `F:\\`, and files are accessed.\n- Network Drive Mounting: A network share `\\\\server\\share` is mapped to the drive `Z:\\`.\n- External Hard Drive Access: An external drive is connected, mounted at `/mnt/backup`, and accessed for copying files.\n- System Volume Access: The system volume `C:\\` is accessed for modifications to critical files.\n- Cloud-Synced Drives: Cloud storage drives like OneDrive or Google Drive are accessed via local mounts.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nWindows Event Logs\n- Relevant Events:\n    - Event ID 4663: Logs access to file or folder objects.\n    - Event ID 4656: Tracks a handle to an object like a drive or file.\n- Configuration:\n    - Enable auditing for \"Object Access\" in Local Security Policy.\n    - Use Group Policy for broader deployment: `Computer Configuration > Windows Settings > Security Settings > Advanced Audit Policy Configuration > Object Access`\n\nLinux System Logs\n\n- Command-Line Monitoring: Use the `dmesg` or `journalctl` command to monitor drive mount/unmount events.\n- Auditd Configuration: Add an audit rule for drive access: `auditctl -w /mnt/drive -p rwxa -k drive_access`\n- Review logs via `/var/log/audit/audit.log`.\n\nmacOS System Logs\n\n- Command-Line Monitoring: Use `diskutil list` or `fs_usage` to monitor drive access and mount points.\n- Unified Logs: Query unified logs using log show for drive-related activities: `log show --info | grep \"mount\"`\n\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Tools\n\n- Use EDR solutions to monitor drive activities and collect detailed forensic data.\n\nSIEM Tools\n\n- Ingest logs from endpoints to detect drive access patterns. Configure rules to alert on unusual or unauthorized drive access.",
