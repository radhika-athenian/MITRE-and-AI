            "description": "Querying and extracting a list of available firewalls or their associated configurations and rules. This activity can occur across host systems and cloud control planes, providing insight into the state and configuration of firewalls that protect the environment. Examples: \n\n- Querying Host-Based Firewalls: Using Windows PowerShell commands like `Get-NetFirewallRule` or Linux commands such as `iptables -L` or `firewalld --list-all`.\n- Cloud Firewall Rule Listing: Running commands like `az network firewall list` for Azure or `aws ec2 describe-security-groups` for AWS.\n- Using Management APIs: Leveraging APIs like Google Cloud Firewall's `list` API method or AWS's DescribeSecurityGroups API.\nIdentifying Misconfigurations: Extracting firewall rules to identify \u201callow all\u201d policies or rules that lack logging.\n- Enumerating with CLI Tools: Using CLI commands like `gcloud compute firewall-rules list` to extract firewall settings in Google Cloud.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nCloud Control Plane\n\n- Azure Activity Logs:Collect logs from Azure Firewall to monitor rule listing commands. Enable logging for `az network firewall` commands.\n- AWS CloudTrail: Monitor calls to `DescribeSecurityGroups` or `DescribeNetworkAcls` APIs.\nGoogle Cloud Operations Suite: Collect logs for `gcloud compute firewall-rules list` or API calls to `firewalls.list`.\n\nHost-Based Firewalls\n\n- Windows Event Logs: Use PowerShell transcription logs to capture commands like `Get-NetFirewallRule`.\n- Linux Auditd: Track executions of commands like `iptables -L` or `ufw status` using auditd: `auditctl -a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S execve -k firewall_enum`\n- macOS: Monitor logs for firewall-related queries via the Console app or log monitoring tools.\n\nSIEM Integration\n\n- Collect logs from endpoints and cloud platforms to centralize data and detect enumeration activity.\n\nEndpoint Detection and Response (EDR)\n\n- Use EDR tools to track enumeration commands or API calls performed on managed devices.\n\nCSPM Tools\n\n- Deploy Cloud Security Posture Management tools to monitor for unauthorized enumeration of firewall rules or configurations.",
