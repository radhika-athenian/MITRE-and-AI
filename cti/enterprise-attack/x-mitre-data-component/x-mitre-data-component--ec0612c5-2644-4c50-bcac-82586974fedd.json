            "description": "This data component refers to monitoring actions that deactivate or stop a cloud service in a cloud control plane. Examples include disabling essential logging services like AWS CloudTrail (`StopLogging` API call), Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs, or Google Cloud's Operations Suite (formerly Stackdriver). Disabling such services can hinder visibility into adversary activities within the cloud environment. Examples: \n\n- AWS CloudTrail StopLogging: This action stops logging of API activity for a particular trail, effectively reducing the monitoring and visibility of AWS resources and activities.\n- Microsoft Azure Monitor Logs: Disabling these logs hinders the organization\u2019s ability to detect anomalous activities and trace malicious actions.\n- Google Cloud Logging: Disabling cloud logging removes visibility into resource activity, preventing monitoring of service access or configuration changes.\n- SaaS Applications: Stopping logging removes visibility into user activities, such as email access or file downloads, enabling undetected malicious behavior.\n\nThis data component can be collected through the following measures:\n\nEnable and Monitor Cloud Service Logging\n\n- Ensure logging is enabled for all cloud services, including administrative actions like StopLogging.\n- Example: Use AWS Config to verify that CloudTrail is enabled and enforce logging as a compliance rule.\n\nAPI Monitoring\n\n- Use API monitoring tools to detect calls like StopLogging or equivalent service-stopping actions in other platforms.\n- Example: Monitor AWS CloudWatch for specific API events such as StopLogging and flag unauthorized users.\n\nSIEM Integration\n\n- Collect logs and events from the cloud control plane into a centralized SIEM for real-time analysis and correlation.\n- Example: Ingest AWS CloudTrail logs into Splunk or Azure Monitor logs into Sentinel.\n\nCloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) Tools\n\n- Leverage CSPM tools like Prisma Cloud, Dome9, or AWS Security Hub to detect misconfigurations or suspicious activity, such as disabled logging.\n- Example: Set alerts for changes to logging configurations in CSPM dashboards.\n\nConfigure Alerts in Cloud Platforms\n\n- Create native alerts in cloud platforms to detect service stoppages.\n- Example: Configure an AWS CloudWatch alarm to trigger when StopLogging is invoked.",
