According to security researchers [ShadowRay](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0045) was the first known instance of AI workloads being activley exploited in the wild through vulnerabilities in AI infrastructure. CVE-2023-48022, which allows access to compute resources and sensitive data for exposed instances, remains unpatched and has been disputed by the vendor as they maintain that Ray is not intended for use outside of a strictly controlled network environment.(Citation: Oligo ShadowRay Campaign MAR 2024)",
