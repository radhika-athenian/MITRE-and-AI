            "description": "[KV Botnet Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0035) consisted of exploitation of primarily \u201cend-of-life\u201d small office-home office (SOHO) equipment from manufacturers such as Cisco, NETGEAR, and DrayTek. [KV Botnet Activity](https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0035) was used by [Volt Typhoon](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G1017) to obfuscate connectivity to victims in multiple critical infrastructure segments, including energy and telecommunication companies and entities based on the US territory of Guam. While the KV Botnet is the most prominent element of this campaign, it overlaps with another botnet cluster referred to as the JDY cluster.(Citation: Lumen KVBotnet 2023) This botnet was disrupted by US law enforcement entities in early 2024 after periods of activity from October 2022 through January 2024.(Citation: DOJ KVBotnet 2024)",
