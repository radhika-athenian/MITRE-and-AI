            "description": "Monitor for newly constructed scheduled jobs by enabling the \"Microsoft-Windows-TaskScheduler/Operational\" setting within the event logging service. (Citation: TechNet Forum Scheduled Task Operational Setting) Several events will then be logged on scheduled task activity, including Event ID 106 on Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 for scheduled task registration. For Windows 10 and Server 2016, the relevant events are also logged in the Windows Security event channel after enabling the auditing of other object access events. These include:\n\n- Event ID 4698: A scheduled task was created.\n- Event ID 4699: A scheduled task was deleted.\n- Event ID 4700: A scheduled task was enabled.\n- Event ID 4701: A scheduled task was disabled.\n- Event ID 4702: A scheduled task was updated.\n\nNote: Detection of the creation or modification of Scheduled Tasks with a suspicious script, extension or user writable path. Attackers may create or modify Scheduled Tasks for the persistent execution of malicious code. This detection focuses at the same time on EventIDs 4688 and 1 with process creation (SCHTASKS) and EventID 4698, 4702 for Scheduled Task creation/modification event log.\n\nAnalytic 1 - New schedule tasks whose content includes suspicious scripts, extensions or user writable path\n\n<code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode IN (4698, 4702, 4699, 4700, 4701)) | where\n(JobContent LIKE '%.cmd%' OR JobContent LIKE '%.ps1%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%.vbs%' OR JobContent LIKE '%.py%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%.js%' OR JobContent LIKE '%.exe%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%.bat%' OR JobContent LIKE '%javascript%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%powershell%' OR JobContent LIKE '%wmic%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%rundll32%' OR JobContent LIKE '%cmd%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%cscript%' OR JobContent LIKE '%wscript%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%regsvr32%' OR JobContent LIKE '%mshta%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%bitsadmin%' OR JobContent LIKE '%certutil%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%msiexec%' OR JobContent LIKE '%javaw%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%[%]APPDATA[%]%' OR JobContent LIKE '%\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%[%]PUBLIC[%]%' OR JobContent LIKE '%C:\\\\Users\\\\Public%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%[%]ProgramData[%]%' OR JobContent LIKE '%C:\\\\ProgramData%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%[%]TEMP[%]%' OR JobContent LIKE '%\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%\\\\Windows\\\\PLA\\\\System%' OR JobContent LIKE '%\\\\tasks%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%\\\\Registration\\\\CRMLog%' OR JobContent LIKE '%\\\\FxsTmp%' OR\n   JobContent LIKE '%\\\\spool\\\\drivers\\\\color%' OR JobContent LIKE '%\\\\tracing%')</code>\n",
