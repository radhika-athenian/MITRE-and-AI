Consider correlation with process monitoring and command line to detect anomalous processes execution and command line arguments associated to traffic patterns (e.g. monitor anomalies in use of files that do not normally initiate connections for respective protocol(s)).\n\nWhile VMCI traffic is invisible to most traditional network sniffing tools, there are ways to potentially monitor this traffic.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence ESXi Hardening 2023)",
