Use of SSH may be legitimate depending on the environment and how it\u2019s used. Other factors, such as access patterns and activity that occurs after a remote login, may indicate suspicious or malicious behavior with SSH.\n\nNetwork Analysis Frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on network traffic.
