Many legitimate modifications are done graphically via\u00a0regedit.exe\u00a0or by using the corresponding channels, or even calling the Registry APIs directly. The built-in utility\u00a0reg.exe\u00a0provides a\u00a0command-line interface\u00a0to the registry, so that queries and modifications can be performed from a shell, such as\u00a0cmd.exe. When a user is responsible for these actions, the parent of\u00a0cmd.exe\u00a0will likely be\u00a0explorer.exe. Occasionally, power users and administrators write scripts that do this behavior as well, but likely from a different process tree. These background scripts must be learned so they can be tuned out accordingly.\n\nOutput Description\nThe sequence of processes that resulted in\u00a0reg.exe\u00a0being started from a shell. That is, a hierarchy that looks like\n\u2022 great-grand_parent.exe\n\u2022 grand_parent.exe\n\u2022 parent.exe\n\u2022 reg.exe\n\nAnalytic 1 - Reg.exe called from Command Shell\n\n<code>(source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") Image=\"reg.exe\" AND ParentImage=\"cmd.exe\"\n| join left=L right=R where L.ParentProcessGuid = R.ProcessGuid \n    [search EventCode IN (1, 4688) Image=\"*cmd.exe\" ParentImage!=\"*explorer.exe\"]</code>",
