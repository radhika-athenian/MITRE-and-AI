This reduces the risk of sensitive data being collected through compromised email accounts.\n\nSet up out-of-band alerts to notify security teams of unusual email activities, such as mass forwarding or large attachments being sent, which could indicate email collection attempts.\n\nCreate plans for leveraging a secure out-of-band communications channel, rather than an existing in-network email server, in case of a security incident.(Citation: TrustedSec OOB Communications)",
