OS API calls associated with LSASS process dumping include <code>OpenProcess</code> and <code>MiniDumpWriteDump</code>. Execution of these functions might trigger security log ids such as 4663 (Microsoft Security Auditing) and 10 (Microsoft Sysmon)\n\n\nNote: Most EDR tools do not support direct monitoring of API calls due to the sheer volume of calls produced by an endpoint but may have alerts or events that are based on abstractions of OS API calls. Dynamic malware analysis tools (i.e., sandboxes) can be used to trace the execution, including OS API calls, for a single PE binary. ",
