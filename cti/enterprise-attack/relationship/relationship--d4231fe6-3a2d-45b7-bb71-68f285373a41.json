If the command line utility\u00a0<code>wmic.exe</code>\u00a0is used on the source host, then it can additionally be detected on an analytic. The command line on the source host is constructed into something like\u00a0<code>wmic.exe /node:\"\\<hostname\\>\" process call create \"\\<command line\\>\"</code>. It is possible to also connect via IP address, in which case the string\u00a0<code>\"\\<hostname\\>\"</code> would instead look like\u00a0IP Address. Processes can be created remotely via WMI in a few other ways, such as more direct API access or the built-in utility\u00a0PowerShell.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process access) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). \n\nBesides executing arbitrary processes, wmic.exe can also be used to executed data stored in NTFS alternate data streams [NTFS File Attributes](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/004).\nLooks for instances of wmic.exe as well as the substrings in the command line:\n- process call create\n- /node:\n\nAnalytic 1 - Detect wmic.exeprocess creation with command lines containing process call create or /node:.\n\n<code> index=security sourcetype=\"WinEventLog:Security\" \n(EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=4656 OR EventCode=4103 OR EventCode=800) \n| eval command_line = coalesce(CommandLine, ParentCommandLine) \n| where (ProcessName=\"wmic.exe\" AND (command_line LIKE \"%/node:%\" OR command_line LIKE \"%process call create%\"))\nOR (command_line LIKE \"*Invoke-WmiMethod*\" OR command_line LIKE \"*Get-WmiObject*\" OR command_line LIKE \"*gwmi*\" OR command_line LIKE \"*win32_process*\")</code>",
