            "description": "Use process monitoring to monitor the execution and arguments of rundll32.exe. Compare recent invocations of rundll32.exe with prior history of known good arguments and loaded DLLs to determine anomalous and potentially adversarial activity. \n\nWhen monitoring for all instances of Rundll32 execution, as defined by the logic in the Detection Pseudocode, it is imperative to also investigate the full set of command-line parameters\u00a0used. These parameters contain key information about the DLL payload, including the name, entry point, and optional arguments.\n\nNote: Event IDs are for Sysmon (Event ID 10 - process create) and Windows Security Log (Event ID 4688 - a new process has been created). The Analytic looks for any instances of rundll32.exe but does no other filtering, which may result in false positives. Therefore, we recommend tuning any such analytics by including additional logic (e.g., testing the name of the user that created the process) that helps reduce false positives.\n\nAnalytic 1 - RunDLL32.exe Monitoring\n \n<code> (source=\"*WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"*WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") Image= \"rundll32.exe\"</code>",
