There is variety between the tools used to compress data, but the command line usage and context of archiving tools, such as ZIP, RAR, and 7ZIP, should be monitored.\nIn addition to looking for RAR or 7z program names, command line usage of 7Zip or RAR can be detected with the flag usage of \u201c\\* a \\*\u201d. This is helpful, as adversaries may change program names.\n\nNote: This analytic looks for the command line argument\u00a0a, which is used by RAR. However, there may be other programs that have this as a legitimate argument and may need to be filtered out.\n\nAnalytic 1 - Command Line Usage of Archiving Software\n\n<code> (source=\"WinEventLog:Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational\" EventCode=\"1\") OR (source=\"WinEventLog:Security\" EventCode=\"4688\") CommandLine=\"* a *\"</code>",
