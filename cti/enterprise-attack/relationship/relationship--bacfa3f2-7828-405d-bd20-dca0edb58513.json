For network devices, monitor executed commands in AAA logs, especially those run by unexpected or unauthorized users. On ESXi servers, monitor for commands that leverage tools like `grep` and `find` to search for files with VM extensions such as `vmdk`, or in VM-related paths such as `/vmfs/*`.(Citation: Elastic ESXI Discovery via Grep)(Citation: Elastic ESXI Discovery via Find)(Citation: Crowdstrike Hypervisor Jackpotting Pt 2 2021)",
