Examples: one account logged into multiple systems simultaneously; multiple accounts logged into the same machine simultaneously; accounts logged in at odd times (ex: when the user is not present) or outside of business hours. Activity may be from interactive login sessions or process ownership from accounts being used to execute binaries on a remote system as a particular account. Correlate other security systems with login information (e.g., a user has an active login session but has not entered the building or does not have VPN access).\n\nAnalytic 1 - Unusual logon patterns and times.\n\n<code> index=linux_logs OR index=macos_logs\n(source=\"/var/log/secure\" OR source=\"/var/log/auth.log\" OR source=\"/var/log/system.log\")\n(\"session opened\" OR \"session closed\")\n| eval is_normal_hours=if(hour(_time) >= 8 AND hour(_time) <= 18, 1, 0)\n| search NOT [search index=linux_logs OR index=macos_logs (source=\"/etc/pam.d/*\" OR source=\"/etc/passwd\" OR source=\"/etc/shadow\") action=modified | fields user]</code>",
