Monitor for any influxes or abnormal increases in DCOM related Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Call (DCE/RPC) traffic (typically over port 135).\n\nRemote Procedure Call (RPC) traffic, especially over port 135, used for DCOM communication. Look for patterns indicating high volumes of RPC calls or connections between systems.\n\nNote: Network Analysis frameworks such as Zeek can be used to capture, decode, and alert on RPC network flows. Traffic to the RPC Endpoint Mapper will always have the destination port of 135. Assuming success, RPC traffic will continue to the endpoint. The endpoint and the client both bind to dynamically assigned ports (on Windows, this is typically greater than 49152). The traffic between the client and endpoint can be detected by looking at traffic to 135 followed by traffic where the source and destination ports are at least 49152.\n\n<code>sourcetype=\"seek\"\n| search dest_port=135 protocol=\"DCE/RPC\"\n| stats count by src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, _time\n| eval rpc_activity=if(count > threshold AND src_ip NOT IN (\"trusted_ips\"), \"suspicious\", \"normal\")\n| where rpc_activity=\"suspicious\"\n| table _time, src_ip, dest_ip, dest_port, rpc_activity </code>",
