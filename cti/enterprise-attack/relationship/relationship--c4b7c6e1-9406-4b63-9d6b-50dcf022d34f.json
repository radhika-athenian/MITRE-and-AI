Additionally, monitor for unexpected or rapid USB HID enumeration events (e.g., a USB HID device connecting and immediately issuing keystrokes) or anomalies (e.g., a device claiming to be a keyboard but has a suspicious vendor ID) that could indicate a possible rogue device. Tools like Windows Event Logs (e.g., event IDs 20001 - 20003), sysfs on Linux (e.g., `/sys/bus/usb/devices/`), and macOS IORegistry (e.g., `ioreg -p IOUSB`) can provide insight into input devices.\n\nAdditionally, consider leveraging keyboard hook APIs to monitor for keystrokes that are too fast and too uniform (e.g., a script executing keystrokes with no human variation or that are too precise). \n\nAnalytic 1 Detect HID like Device Injection \n\n<code> index=wineventlog sourcetype=\"WinEventLog:System\" EventCode=400 OR EventCode=20001\n| eval usb_device=coalesce(UsbDevice, DeviceName)\n| search usb_device=\"*keyboard*\" OR usb_device=\"*HID*\"\n| transaction usb_device maxspan=30s\n| join usb_device\n    [\n      search index=main sourcetype=\"WinEventLog:Security\" (EventCode=4688 OR EventCode=4104)\n      | stats count by usb_device, _time, CommandLine, ParentProcessName, NewProcessName\n    ]\n| where count > 0\n| table _time, usb_device, NewProcessName, CommandLine, ParentProcessName\n</code>",
