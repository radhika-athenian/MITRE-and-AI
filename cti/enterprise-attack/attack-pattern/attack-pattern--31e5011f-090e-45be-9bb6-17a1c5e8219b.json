Persistent background services on ESXi-hosted VMs, such as the VMware Tools Daemon Service, allow for remote management from the ESXi server. The tools daemon service runs as `vmtoolsd.exe` on Windows guest operating systems, `vmware-tools-daemon` on macOS, and `vmtoolsd ` on Linux.(Citation: Broadcom VMware Tools Services) \n\nAdversaries may leverage a variety of tools to execute commands on ESXi-hosted VMs \u2013 for example, by using the vSphere Web Services SDK to programmatically execute commands and scripts via APIs such as `StartProgramInGuest`, `ListProcessesInGuest`,  `ListFileInGuest`, and `InitiateFileTransferFromGuest`.(Citation: Google Cloud Threat Intelligence VMWare ESXi Zero-Day 2023)(Citation: Broadcom Running Guest OS Operations) This may enable follow-on behaviors on the guest VMs, such as [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083), [Data from Local System](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1005), or [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003).
