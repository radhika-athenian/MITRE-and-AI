            "description": "Restricting file and directory permissions involves setting access controls at the file system level to limit which users, groups, or processes can read, write, or execute files. By configuring permissions appropriately, organizations can reduce the attack surface for adversaries seeking to access sensitive data, plant malicious code, or tamper with system files.\n\nEnforce Least Privilege Permissions:\n\n- Remove unnecessary write permissions on sensitive files and directories.\n- Use file ownership and groups to control access for specific roles.\n\nExample (Windows): Right-click the shared folder \u2192 Properties \u2192 Security tab \u2192 Adjust permissions for NTFS ACLs.\n\nHarden File Shares:\n\n- Disable anonymous access to shared folders.\n- Enforce NTFS permissions for shared folders on Windows.\n\nExample: Set permissions to restrict write access to critical files, such as system executables (e.g., `/bin` or `/sbin` on Linux). Use tools like `chown` and `chmod` to assign file ownership and limit access.\n\nOn Linux, apply:\n`chmod 750 /etc/sensitive.conf`\n`chown root:admin /etc/sensitive.conf`\n\nFile Integrity Monitoring (FIM):\n\n- Use tools like Tripwire, Wazuh, or OSSEC to monitor changes to critical file permissions.\n\nAudit File System Access:\n\n- Enable auditing to track permission changes or unauthorized access attempts.\n- Use auditd (Linux) or Event Viewer (Windows) to log activities.\n\nRestrict Startup Directories:\n\n- Configure permissions to prevent unauthorized writes to directories like `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu`.\n\nExample: Restrict write access to critical directories like `/etc/`, `/usr/local/`, and Windows directories such as `C:\\Windows\\System32`.\n\n- On Windows, use icacls to modify permissions: `icacls \"C:\\Windows\\System32\" /inheritance:r /grant:r SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)F`\n- On Linux, monitor permissions using tools like `lsattr` or `auditd`.",
