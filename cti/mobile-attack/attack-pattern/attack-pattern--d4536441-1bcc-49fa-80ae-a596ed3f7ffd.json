However, starting with Android 10, only preloaded, carrier, the default SMS, or device and profile owner applications can access the telephony-related device identifiers.(Citation: TelephonyManager) \n\n \n\nOn iOS, gathering network configuration information is not possible without root access. \n\n \n\nAdversaries may use the information from [System Network Configuration Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1422) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including determining certain access within the target network and what actions to do next.
