After Android 7, only device or profile owners (e.g. MDMs) can reset the device\u2019s passcode.(Citation: Android resetPassword)\n\nOn iOS devices, this technique does not work because mobile device management servers can only remove the screen lock passcode; they cannot set a new passcode. However, on jailbroken devices, malware has been discovered that can lock the user out of the device.(Citation: Xiao-KeyRaider)",
