This may be performed during automated discovery and can be accomplished in numerous ways such as using `adb shell netstat` for Android.(Citation: adb_commands)\n\nAdversaries may use the results and responses from these requests to determine if the mobile devices are capable of communicating with adversary-owned C2 servers before attempting to connect to them. The results may also be used to identify routes, redirectors, and proxy servers.",
