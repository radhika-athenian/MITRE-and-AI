This allows adversaries to make purchases on behalf of the user, with little or no user interaction.(Citation: Google Bread)\n\nMalicious applications may also perform toll billing, which occurs when carriers provide payment endpoints over a web page. The application connects to the web page over cellular data so the carrier can directly verify the number, or the application must retrieve a code sent via SMS and enter it into the web page.(Citation: Google Bread)\n\nOn iOS, apps cannot send SMS messages.\n\nOn Android, apps must hold the `SEND_SMS` permission to send SMS messages. Additionally, Android version 4.2 and above has mitigations against this threat by requiring user consent before allowing SMS messages to be sent to premium numbers (Citation: AndroidSecurity2014).",
