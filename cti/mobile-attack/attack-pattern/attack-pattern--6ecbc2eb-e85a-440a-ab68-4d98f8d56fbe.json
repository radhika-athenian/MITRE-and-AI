            "description": "Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities to gain initial access to a mobile device. \n\nThis can be accomplished in a variety of ways. Vulnerabilities may be present in the applications, the services, the underlying operating system, or the kernel itself. Several well-known mobile device exploits exist, including FORCEDENTRY, StageFright, and BlueBorne. Furthermore, some exploits may be possible to exploit without any user interaction (i.e. zero-click exploits, see [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1658)), making them particularly dangerous. Mobile operating system vendors are typically very quick to patch such critical bugs, ensuring only a small window where they can be exploited. ",
