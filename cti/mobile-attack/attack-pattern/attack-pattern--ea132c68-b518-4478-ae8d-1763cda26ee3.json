By doing so, adversaries may conceal captured files, such as pictures, videos and/or screenshots, then later exfiltrate those files.  \n\nSpecific to Android devices, if the `.nomedia` file is present in a folder, multimedia files in that folder will not be visible to the user in the Gallery application. Additionally, other applications are asked not to scan the folder with the `.nomedia` file, effectively making the folder appear invisible to the user.  \n\nThis technique is often used by stalkerware and spyware applications.
