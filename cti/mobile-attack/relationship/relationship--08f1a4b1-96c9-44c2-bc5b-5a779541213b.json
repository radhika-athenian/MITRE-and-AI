[Dvmap](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0420) can inject code by patching `libdmv.so` or `libandroid_runtime.so`, depending on the Android OS version. Both libraries are related to the Dalvik and ART runtime environments. The patched functions can only call `/system/bin/ip`, which was replaced with the malicious version.(Citation: SecureList DVMap June 2017)",
