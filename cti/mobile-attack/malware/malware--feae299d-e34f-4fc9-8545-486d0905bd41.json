Analysis suggests that [Sunbird](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1082) was first active in early 2017. While [Sunbird](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1082) and [Hornbill](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1077) overlap in core capabilities, [Sunbird](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1082) has a more extensive set of malicious features.(Citation: lookout_hornbill_sunbird_0221)",
