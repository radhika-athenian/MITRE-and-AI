Analysis suggests that [Hornbill](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1077) was first active in early 2018. While [Hornbill](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1077) and [Sunbird](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1082) overlap in core capabilities, [Hornbill](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S1077) has tools and behaviors suggesting more passive reconnaissance.(Citation: lookout_hornbill_sunbird_0221)",
